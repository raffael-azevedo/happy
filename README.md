<h2 align="center">About ðŸ“–</h2>
   
<p align="center">

    hAPPy is a project developed during the Next Level Week, idealized by <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a>, starting October 12th until October 18th.<br>
      
    The main idea of the project is to encourage people to visit orphanages. Many children live in orphanages, and their reality isn't always good. A little love and cherish from us is good to keep them believing that the world is still a good place to live.<br>

    The purpose of this challenge is to build a web app where you can find orphanages close to you and pay a visit, spreading happiness to the little ones.<br>
